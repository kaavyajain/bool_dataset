GONE ASTRAY

A COUNTRY village wrapped in the darkness of night. One o’clock strikes
from the belfry. Two lawyers, called Kozyavkin and Laev, both in the
best of spirits and a little unsteady on their legs, come out of the
wood and turn towards the cottages.

“Well, thank God, we’ve arrived,” says Kozyavkin, drawing a deep breath.
“Tramping four miles from the station in our condition is a feat. I am
fearfully done up! And, as ill-luck would have it, not a fly to be
seen.”

The friends go up to one of the cottages, and stand still under the
nearest window.

His performance is cut short by a sudden fit of coughing. “Tphoo!
Verotchka, tell Aksinya to unlock the gate for us!” A pause.
“Verotchka! don’t be lazy, get up, darling!” He stands on a stone and
looks in at the window. “Verotchka, my dumpling; Verotchka, my poppet my little angel, my wife beyond compare, get up and tell Aksinya to
unlock the gate for us! You are not asleep, you know. Little wife, we
are really so done up and exhausted that we’re not in the mood for
jokes. We’ve trudged all the way from the station! Don’t you hear? Ah,
hang it all!” He makes an effort to climb up to the window and falls
down. “You know this isn’t a nice trick to play on a visitor! I see you
are just as great a schoolgirl as ever, Vera, you are always up to
mischief!”
