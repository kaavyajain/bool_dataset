
A PIANO TUNER called Murkin, a close shaven man with a yellow face, with
a nose stained with snuff, and cotton wool in his ears, came out of his
hotel-room into the passage, and in a cracked voice cried: “Semyon!
Waiter!”

And looking at his frightened face one might have supposed that the
ceiling had fallen in on him or that he had just seen a ghost in his
room.

Semyon went into Murkin’s room, looked at the place where he was in the
habit of putting the boots he had cleaned, and scratched his head: the
boots were not there.

“Where can they be, the damned things?” Semyon brought out. “I fancy I
cleaned them in the evening and put them here.

“It’s I!” Murkin began in a plaintive voice, standing in the attitude of
a cavalier addressing a lady of the highest society. “Pardon my
disturbing you, madam, but I am a man in delicate health, rheumatic .The doctors, madam, have ordered me to keep my feet warm, especially
as I have to go at once to tune the piano at Madame la grale
Shevelitsyn’s. I can’t go to her barefoot.”
