
HOSPITAL assistant, called Yergunov, empty-headed fellow, known
throughout district for being great braggart and drunkard, was returning
one evening in Christmas week from hamlet of Ryepino, where Ryepino had
been to make some purchases for the hospital. That he might get home in
good time and not be late, the doctor had lent him his very best horse.

He did not know how to drive, he did not know the road, and he drove on
at random, hoping that the horse would find the way of itself. Two hours
passed; the horse was exhausted, he himself was chilled, and already
began to fancy that he was not going home, but back towards Ryepino. But
at last above the uproar of the storm he heard the far-away barking of a
dog, and a murky red blur came into sight ahead of him.

The first room into which he went was large and very hot, and smelt of
freshly washed floors. A short, lean peasant of about forty, with a
small, fair beard, wearing a dark blue shirt, was sitting at the table
under the holy images. It was Kalashnikov, an arrant scoundrel and
horse-stealer, whose father and uncle kept a tavern in Bogalyovka, and
disposed of the stolen horses where they could. He too had been to the
hospital more than once, not for medical treatment, but to see the
doctor about horses to ask whether he had not one for sale, and whether
his honour would not like to swop his bay mare for a duncoloured
gelding. Now his head was pomaded and a silver earring glittered in his
ear, and altogether he had a holiday air.
