A DEFENCELESS CREATURE

IN spite of a violent attack of gout in the night and the nervous
exhaustion left by it, Kistunov went in the morning to his office and
began punctually seeing the clients of the bank and persons who had come
with petitions. He looked languid and exhausted, and spoke in a faint
voice hardly above a whisper, as though he were dying.

“You see, your Excellency,” the petitioner in question began, speaking
rapidly, “my husband Shtchukin, a collegiate assessor, was ill for five
months, and while he, if you will excuse my saying so, was laid up at
home, he was for no sort of reason dismissed, your Excellency; and when
I went for his salary they deducted, if you please, your Excellency,
twenty-four roubles thirty-six kopecks from his salary. ‘What for?’ I
asked. ‘He borrowed from the club fund,’ they told me, ‘and the other
clerks had stood security for him.’ How was that? How could he have
borrowed it without my consent? It’s impossible, your Excellency. What’s
the reason of it?"

The petitioner was blinking, and dived into her mantle for her
handkerchief. Kistunov took her petition from her and began reading it.

Kistunov was conscious of the palpitation of his heart. With a face of
anguish, pressing his hand on his heart, he began explaining to Madame
Shtchukin again, but his voice failed him.
