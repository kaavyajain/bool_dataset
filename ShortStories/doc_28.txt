A PLAY

“PAVEL VASSILYEVITCH, there’s a lady here, asking for you,” Luka
announced. “She’s been waiting a good hour.”

Pavel Vassilyevitch had only just finished lunch. Hearing of the lady,
he frowned.

Without haste Pavel Vassilyevitch put on his coat, took a pen in one
hand, and a book in the other, and trying to look as though he were very
busy he went into the study. There the visitor was awaiting him—a large
stout lady with a red, beefy face, in spectacles. She looked very
respectable, and her dress was more than fashionable (she had on a
crinolette of four storeys and a high hat with a reddish bird in it). On
seeing him she turned up her eyes and folded her hands in supplication.

Nervously, with the flutter of a captured bird, the lady fumbled in her
skirt and drew out a fat manuscript.

Pavel Vassilyevitch liked no articles but his own. When threatened with
the necessity of reading other people’s, or listening to them, he felt
as though he were facing the cannon’s mouth. Seeing the manuscript he
took fright and hastened to say.

The jury acquitted him.
